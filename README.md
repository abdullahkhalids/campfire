campfire
========

campfire is a model for parabolic solar troughs.

Please start with constants.m. Define the properties of your system. Most properties are self explanatory.

Then run mainLinear.m to run a simulation of the model and display some results.

mainFieldLCOE.m is a script that also runs costing code associated with the model. This allows you to compute
the levelized cost of energy produced by the parabolic trough.
