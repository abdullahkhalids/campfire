campfire
========

campfire is a model for parabolic solar troughs, written in MATLAB.

It consists of a optical and a thermal model. There is a also a basic costing code, that allows you to compute
the LCOE of a trough.

It was written by Abdullah Khalid and Hassan Bukhari with the support of the Lahore University of Management 
Sciences (LUMS) in Pakistan. 

Usage
=====

Please start with constants.m. Define the properties of your system. Most properties are self explanatory.

Then run mainLinear.m to run a simulation of the model and display some results.

mainFieldLCOE.m is a script that also runs costing code associated with the model. 

License
=======

We would like everyone to use this model and improve upon it. The exact license is as yet undecided, but it will
allow all usage, even for commercial purposes.
