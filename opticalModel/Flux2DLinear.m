function [isIntersection,intensitiesReflection] = Flux2DLinear(parabola,receiver,sun,atmosphere,simulation)
%FLUX2D Computes the flux on a parabola.

% common calculation

% The sun throws light rays at all points.
% Compute the incidence angles, vectors and intensities

% These rays are reflected off the reflector surface
