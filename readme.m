%Implements the following features
%1.The simulation is only in 2D.
%2.The trough is a parabola. The receiver a circle with random
%perturbations on it. The geometerical properties including orientation and
%position of both objects is full y definable.
%3. The sun's position can be given. The sun only sends out single rays
%rather than cones.
%4. No transmission, reflection and other coefficients have been used as
%yet. All incident light on the trough is reflected.
%5. The intensity on every point on the receiver is available, but not the
%incident angles.
