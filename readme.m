%Implements the following features
%1.The simulation is only in3D.
%2.The trough is a parabola. The receiver a cyclinder with random
%perturbations on it. The geometerical properties including orientation and
%position of both objects is fully definable.
%3. The sun's position can be given. The sun cones of light.
%4. Light is reflected from the trough as per the reflection coefficient.
%However, the refractive index is still considered to be wavelength
%independent and the spectrum of the incoming sunlight is not considered.
%6. Specularity has been implemented
%7. Now a proper receiver model that works.
